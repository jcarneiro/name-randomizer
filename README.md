## Overview

On startup the application attempts to read any saved player data in `players.json`. If this file is missing the initial state will be an empty set of players. Any changes made to the player data is automatically saved to the `players.json` file. Players can be added via the "Add Player" button. Players can be removed via the "Delete" icon located at the top right corner of their respective name tags. Player information can be edited by clicking the "Edit" icon located to the left of the "Delete" icon. An active player can be benched by clicking his or her name tag; similarly, a benched player can be made active by clicking his or her name tag. Teams of 2, 3, or 4 are generated by clicking the corresponding "Team of" button.

## Install

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/jcarneiro/name-randomizer your-project-name
```

And then install the dependencies with yarn.

```bash
$ cd your-project-name
$ yarn
```

## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:

```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ yarn package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to the [Multi Platform Build docs](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build) for dependencies.

Then,

```bash
$ yarn package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ yarn package --[option]
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ yarn build-e2e
$ yarn test-e2e

# Running e2e tests in a minimized window
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn build-e2e
$ yarn test-e2e
```

:bulb: You can debug your production build with devtools by simply setting the `DEBUG_PROD` env variable:

```bash
DEBUG_PROD=true yarn package
```
